"""
K-Means Clustering is first Unsupervised ML subjects one.
K-Means Clustering can be process without data labels. Target is find data labels and split.
WCSS == Within clues of sum squares (distance(Pi,Cn)^2).
 Steps:
    1) Choose K value point (K = n).
    2) Choose random centroid data point.
    3) Assign a centroid nearest data value and split data. (Euclidean distance)
    4) Assign again a centroid and get average data point.
    5) We change our k value until the average of the data changes.
